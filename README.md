20 days of JavaScript coding streak - day 14

In the above program, the first argument of the twoDimensionArray() function represents the number of array elements, and the second argument represents the number of array elements inside of each array element.

The first for loop is used to create a two dimensional array. [[], []]

The second for loop iterates over each array element and inserts the elements inside of an array element.
